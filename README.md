Good day! Here is our Pet Adoption Web Project: Wags & Whiskers!

## Project Summary
Pet Adoption Site - Wags & Whiskers

Our team created a clone of a pet adoption site and named it Wags & Whiskers. 

Upon a user's arrival, they will be greeted by the landing page which offers various topics about the pets that are up for adoption. The site is divided into two major pages, one for dogs and another for cats. These pages show different topics about the pets like how to groom them, their behavior and traits, different breeds or what is a proper nutrition for them. The site also has a pet gallery showing the different pets for adoption. Upon picking a pet, a user can schedule a visit to the shelter.

Other features of the site are a FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) section, a page about the company and some videos about the pets.

I have also added a javascript function that filters the pets according to their type (ie Cats or Dogs), or showing each and everyone of them. It also has a back-to-top feature.

    - My second page is a scheduling page. Upon choosing a pet, you must now schedule a date for a visit to the shelter in order to meet them. It has a form validation and saves the schedule details in the local storage. This acts like a saving function in the absence of backend coding and a database.

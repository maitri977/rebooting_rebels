<h1>FAQs(Frequently Asked Questions)</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        How Can I Find a New Home for a Pet I Already Have?
    </h3>
    <p1>
        We know rehoming your pet is a difficult decision. The good news is that we can help. <br>
        Check out Rehome by Adopt-a-Pet.com and The Petco Foundation. <br>
        It’s the safe, free, and reliable way to find a great new home for your pet. We’d rather help you <br>
        keep your pet, though, so please take a look at these resources, designed to help you and your best pal <br>
        stay together. <br>
    </p1>
    <h3>
        I'm Interested in Volunteering. How Can I Help?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Thank you for your interest in volunteering! Animals always need people who are willing to share their <br>
        time and talents.<br>
        Whether you are interested in working directly with homeless pets, working from home and helping shelters <br>
        andrescue groups to upload their pets' info onto our site, or finding other ways to help homeless pets,  <br>
        click here to get involved!
    </p>
    <h3>
        How Can I Get Specific Information About a Pet I've Seen on This Site?
    </h3>
    <p>
        If you have questions about a specific pet you saw (whether he or she is still available, personality <br>
        characteristics, etc.) or about the adoption policies of a particular shelter or group (whether they <br>
        allow adoptions out of state, how much adoption fees are, etc.), you will need to contact the shelter <br>
        or rescue group directly.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Why is my veterinarian referring my pet to a specialist?</h3>
    <p>We want our patients to have the best possible outcome. This is why we sometimes make the
       decision to refer patients to veterinary specialists or specialty clinics when advanced 
       training or equipment will be beneficial. Our veterinarians make every effort to stay
       current and skilled in many aspects of animal health. However, board-certified specialists
       have extensive experience and training in a particular area of veterinary medicine or 
       surgery. And specialty clinics and university-affiliated referral centres have specialized
       equipment to perform procedures that are not routinely undertaken by general practitioners.
       Be assured that when we refer a patient to another hospital, we continue to stay involved
       with his or her care, consulting with the treating specialist and often providing any 
       needed follow-up care and rehabilitation.</p>
    <h3>What Dog and Cat foods do you recommend?</h3>
    <p>There are many great brands out there. The ones we recommend the most are based on years 
       of results and healthy dogs and cats. Occasionally, prescription diets are recommended 
       based on a pet's specific needs.</p>
    <h3>When do i switch from puppy/kitten food to adult food?</h3>
    <p>Switching a puppy or kitten to adult food too early can cause obesity and gastro-intestinal 
        issues. We recommend switching to adult dog or cat food between 10-12 months. Check with 
        us before you make a change. </p>
    <h3>Where do i take my pet in case of emergency?</h3>
    <p>Ifthere is an emergency during business hours, simply call our office ahead of time so 
        we know what to expect and bring your pet in. If there is an emergency after hours, our
        answering service can connect you to a member of our team, who will direct you to the 
        nearest emergency clinic if necessary.</p>
    <h3>How often do I need to bathe my dog/cat?</h3>
    <p>If no skin condition is present, you can bathe your dog every 4-6 weeks. In some cases, 
        you may need to bathe them more often than that, but no more than once a week. It is 
        important to use Pet Shampoos (not people shampoos) in order to not damage or cause 
        allergy outbreaks on your pet's skin.</p>
    <h3>What is Kennel Cough?</h3>
    <p>It is an upper respiratory infection that is contagious among dogs, particularly when 
       they are in close settings such as a kennel, groomer, or a dog park. Some symptoms can 
       include coughing, lethargy (lack of energy), and lack of appetite. If left untreated, 
       Kennel Cough can be difficult and costly to treat, and it can also cause a lot of pain 
       and lead to pneumonia. If you are boarding your pet at out our facility, we do require 
       that the Bordetella vaccine be given to your pet prior to boarding. We also recommend 
       that the vaccination be given yearly.</p>
    <h3>What is pre-anesthetic blood screen?</h3>
    <p>A pre-anesthetic blood screen is the process of drawing your pet's blood and testing it 
        prior to a surgical procedure. We are able to then identify any underlying issues that 
        could potentially complicate the procedure. All of our testing is done in-house which 
        allows us to get a quicker response and serve you better. For the safety of your pet, 
        we do blood-screening prior to any surgical procedure.</p>
    <h3>Does my pet need dental care?</h3>
    <p>Dental health  is just as important for dogs and cats as it is for people. Bacteria and 
        food  accumulate around the teeth and, if left unchecked, will lead to gingivitis loss 
        of bone and soft tissue. This can result in tooth loss, an abscess, or a bacterial 
        infection. Unless your pet just ate something fishy, stinky breath isn’t normal. Having 
        a veterinarian evaluate your pet’s teeth regularly and cleaning them as needed will help
        prevent periodontal disease and any related problems. Visit our Pet Dental Care page 
        for more information</p>
    <h3>How much does it cost to trim my pets nails/hairs and can i just drop-off my pet to 
        get it done?</h3>
    <p>Long nails and hairs can be a headache! We are happy to trim your pet's nails/hairs for a
       nominal fee of $8. To get your pet's nails trimmed, you can give us a call, or make an 
       appointment conveniently online on our page.We also accept drop-offs.</p>
